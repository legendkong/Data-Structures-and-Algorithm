# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm
A documentation of my struggling journey with Data Structures and Algorithm. Entering the playing field with absolutely zero knowledge on DSA. LFG!

My journey begins on 06 Feb 2022.
After much persuasion from Fiora, I have decided to finally venture into the world of DSA after doing many if else statements and boring basic codes for my school assignments.
